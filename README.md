### DESCRIPTION ###
modified AES-128 Implementation and sample code

### CAUTION ###
This is NOT a standard AES-128 implementation and some parts are unnecessary, ineffective or strange because this is written for an assignment.
This source will not be updated because I've already submitted assignment and got a grade.

### KEY POINTS ###
#### SAME ####
- Mix Column
- Round Key Generation
- PKCS #7 Padding
- And many other things I've forgot...

#### DIFFERENT ####
- Different S-Box Implementation
- Different Shift Row Implementation
- Print text through stdout
- And many other things I've forgot...
